# Node Express Handlebars

This app is all about eating burgers, yes, that's right! You'll create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). Be sure to follow the MVC design pattern; use Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate your HTML.
* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.
```

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the
 left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user
 clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

```

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Instructions on setting up and running this app on your computer

#### App Setup

1. Fork a copy to your Github repo and clone it to your computer.

1. Got to your Git Bash and got to into the folder called Eat-Da-Burger.

1. To get all the npm packages required to run this app type into the command line `npm install`

1. Create a server.js file.


#### Database Setup

1. On your computer, open MySQL Workbench and login to a local server you have set up. 

__One option for executing the database code required to run the app is:__

1. Open a new SQL tab for executing queries.

1. Then go back to your chosen text editor (I suggest either Visual Studio or Sublime Text) and open your `Eat-Da-Burger` folder.

1. Inside the `Eat-Da-Burger` folder you will find a folder named `db`.

1. In the `db` folder, open the file named `schema.sql`. Copy the code in the file and paste it to the new SQL tab you opened in MySQL Workbench.

1. Go back to the `db` folder in you text editor and open the `seeds.sql` file and copy the code and paste it into the open tab in MySQL Workbench and execute the code.


__The other option for running the MySQL code is to:__


1. Run the `schema.sql` and `seeds.sql` files into the mysql server from the command line

1. Now you're going to run these SQL files.

1. Make sure you're in the `db` folder of your app.

1. Start MySQL command line tool and login: `mysql -u root -p`.

1. With the `mysql>` command line tool running, enter the command `source schema.sql`. This will run your schema file and all of the queries in it -- in other words, you'll be creating your database.

1. Now insert the entries you defined in `seeds.sql` by running the file: `source seeds.sql`.

1. Close out of the MySQL command line tool: `exit`.


#### .env file Setup

1. In the command line of the main folder of `Eat-Da-Burger` type `touch .env` 

1. In your text editor, open the `.env` file and type `MYSQL_PASSWORD = "enter your MySQL password here"`

1. Save the file


#### Open App in Browser

1. In the command line go into main folder of `Eat-Da-Burger`

1. Type `node server.js` end hit enter

1. Go to your browser and open a new tab and type `localhost:3000` then hit enter

As you can see from the image there are 3 columns: Ready to Eat da Burger, Devoured Burgers, Order da Burger 


#### Using the App

**Eat da Burger Option**

* In the `Ready to Eat da Burger` column, if you hit the `Devour It !` button it will change the devour status to true in MySQL, which will place the burger in the Devoured Burgers column. This burger will still be listed in MySQL. For example, if you choose to devour the Grilled Onion Cheeseburger, this is what it looks like in MySQL. Note that the Devour number is a 0 which equals true:

	![Image of MySQL Before Devour](./public/assets/img/mysql1.PNG)

* If then I hit the button to devour it, you can see that the Devour number changes to false, which in binary code is 1:
<<<<<<< HEAD

**Reorder da Burger**

* You can choose to reorder a burger that was eaten if it sounds good to you. Just hit the `Reoder It` button under Devoured Burgers and it will show as Ready to Eat again.

**Order da Burger**

* You can add or order a burger by going to that column and typing in the name of your favorite buger then hit order. The burger will be added to the Eat da Burger column since the default setting on adding a burger is to set the Devour to true, which places it in that column.

* Here is MySQL before I added the burger:

## Issues

* One issue that I have noticed is that there is a lag in time between making changes on the browser and those changes being updated to the browser and MySQL.
